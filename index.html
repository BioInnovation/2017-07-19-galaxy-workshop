<h2>Tutorial Overview</h2>

<p>This tutorial will cover the basics of RNA-seq using Galaxy and Degust.</p>

<p>It is recommended you have some familiarity with Galaxy before using this <a href="http://vlsci.github.io/lscc_docs/tutorials/galaxy_101/galaxy_101/">Galaxy</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Background [15 min]</h2>

<h4>Where does the data in this tutorial come from?</h4>

<p>The data for this tutorial is from the paper, <em>A comprehensive comparison of
RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis from reads to differential gene expression
and cross-comparison with microarrays: a case study in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</em> by Nookaew et al. [1] which studies S.cerevisiae strain CEN.PK
113-7D (yeast) under two different metabolic conditions: glucose-excess (batch)
or glucose-limited (chemostat).</p>

<p>The RNA-Seq data has been uploaded in NCBI, short read archive (SRA), with
accession SRS307298. There are 6 samples in total-- two treatments with
three biological replicates each sequenced paired-end.  We have selected only
the first read, and only two replicates of each condition to keep the data small
for this workshop.</p>

<p>We have extracted chromosome I reads from the samples to make the
tutorial a suitable length. This has implications, as discussed in section 8.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 1: Preparation [15 min]</h2>

<h4>1.  Register as a new user on our Monash Galaxy server</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Open a browser and go to a Galaxy server : <a href="http://galaxy.erc.monash.edu/galaxy/">galaxy.erc.monash.edu/galaxy</a></p></li>
<li><p>Register as a new user by clicking <strong>User > Register</strong> on the top
dark-grey bar. Alternatively, if you already have an account, login by
clicking <strong>User > Login</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>2.  Import the RNA-seq data for the workshop.</h4>

<p>You can import the data by:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the tool panel located on the left, under Basic Tools select <strong>Get
Data > Upload File</strong>. Click on the <strong>Paste/Fetch data</strong> button on the
bottom section of the pop-up window.</li>
<li><p>Upload the sequence data by pasting the following links into the text
input area.
These two files are single-end samples from the batch condition
(glucose-excess). Make sure the type is specified as 'fastqsanger'
when uploading.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/batch1_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/batch2_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
</div>

<p>These two files are single-end samples from the chem condition
(glucose-limited). Make sure the type is specified as 'fastqsanger'
when uploading.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/chem1_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/chem2_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
</div>

<p>Then, upload this file of gene definitions. You do not need to specify
the type for this file as Galaxy will auto-detect the file as a GTF
file.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/genes.gtf
</div></li>
<li><p>You should now have these 5 files in your history:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>batch1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>batch2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>genes.gtf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These files can be renamed by clicking the <strong>pen icon</strong> if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Low quality reads have already been trimmed.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Section 2: FastQC</h2>

<ul>
<li>From the left hand tool panel in Galaxy, under <em>NGS ANALYSIS</em>, select <em>NGS: QC and manipulation -> FastQC</em></li>
<li>Select one of the FASTQ files as input and <em>Execute</em> the tool.</li>
<li>When the tool finishes running, you should have an HTML file in your History. Click on the eye icon to view the various quality metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look at the generated FastQC metrics. This data looks pretty good - high per-base quality scores (most above 30).</p>

<p><img src="media/fastqc.png" height=700px></p>

<h2>Section 3: Alignment [30 mins]</h2>

<p>In this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As
these reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron
boundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware
mapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results
from Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on
Tophat can be found <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<h4>1.  Map/align the reads with Tophat to the S. cerevisiae reference</h4>

<p>In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Tophat</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is this single-end or paired-end data?</strong> Single-end (as individual datasets)  </li>
<li><p><strong>RNA-Seq FASTQ file, forward reads:</strong> <br />
(Click on the <strong>multiple datasets icon</strong> and select all four of the
FASTQ files)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>batch1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>batch2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a built in reference genome or own from your history:</strong> Use
built-in genome</p></li>
<li><strong>Select a reference genome:</strong> S. cerevisiae June 2008 (SGD/SacCer2)
(sacCer2)</li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_tophat.png" height=800px></p>

<p>Note: This may take a few minutes, depending on how busy the server is.</p>

<h4>2.  Rename the output files</h4>

<p>You should have 5 output files for each of the FASTQ input files:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 2 and data 1: accepted_hits:</strong> This is a BAM file containing
sequence alignment data of the reads. This file contains the location
of where the reads mapped to in the reference genome. We will examine
this file more closely in the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 2 and data 1: splice junctions:</strong> This file lists all the places
where TopHat had to split a read into two pieces to span an exon
junction.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 2 and data 1 deletions</strong> and <strong>Tophat on data 2 and data 1: insertions:</strong>
These files list small insertions or deletions found in the reads.
Since we are working with synthetic reads we can ignore Tophat for
Illumina data 1:insertions Tophat for Illumina data 1:deletions for now.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 2 and data 1: align_summary:</strong> This file gives some mapping
statistics including the number of reads mapped and the mapping rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have a total of 20 Tophat output files in your history.</p>

<p>Rename the 4 accepted_hits files into a more meaningful name (e.g.
'Tophat on data 2 and data 1: accepted<em>hits' to 'batch1-accepted</em>hits.bam')
by using the <strong>pen icon</strong> next to the file.</p>

<h4>3.  Visualise the aligned reads with Trackster</h4>

<ol>
<li>On the top bar of Galaxy, select <strong>Visualization > New Track Browser</strong>.</li>
<li>Name your new visualization and select S. cerevisiae (sacCer2) as the
reference genome build.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Datasets to Visualization</strong> button and select
<code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code> and <code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code> by using the
checkboxes on the left.</li>
<li>Select chrI from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the
buttons on the top toolbar.</li>
<li>You can also add more tracks using the <strong>Add Tracks icon</strong> located on the
top right. Load one of the splice junction files such as 'Tophat on data 2
and data 1: splice junctions'.</li>
<li>Explore the data and try to find a splice junction. Next to the
drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number
display and specify the location <strong>chrI:86985-87795</strong> to view an
intron junction.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally we would add a gene model to the visualisation; but the
genes.gtf file for S. cerevisae (as downloaded from UCSC Table Browser)
has a slightly different naming convention for one of the chromosomes
than the reference genome used by Galaxy, which will cause an error to
be thrown by Trackster if you try to add it. This is very typical of
genomics currently! If you are interested, you can fiddle with the
genes.gtf file to rename the chromosome '2-micron' to '2micron', which
will fix the problem.</p>

<p>Before starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return
to the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top
Galaxy toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="media/trackster.png"></p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 4. Count reads in features [30 min]</h2>

<p>HTSeq-count creates a count matrix using the number of the reads from each bam
file that map to the genomic features in the genes.gtf. For each feature (a
gene for example) a count matrix shows how many reads were mapped to this
feature.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature. <br />
In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > SAM/BAM to count matrix</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gene model (GFF) file to count reads over from your current history:</strong> genes.gtf</li>
<li><strong>bam/sam file from your history:</strong> <br />
(Select all six bam files using the shift key.)
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Examine the outputted matrix by using the <strong>eye icon</strong>. <br />
Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to a gene. By
sight, see if you can find a gene you think is differentially expressed
from looking at the counts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We now have a count matrix, with a count against each corresponding sample. We
will use this matrix in later sections to calculate the differentially
expressed genes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 5: edgeR  [30 min]</h2>

<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">edgeR</a>
is an R package, that is used for analysing differential expression of
RNA-Seq data and can either use exact statistical methods or generalised
linear models.</p>

<h4>1.  Generate a list of differentially expressed genes using edgeR</h4>

<p>In the Galaxy tool panel, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Differential_Count</strong> and set the parameters as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Select an input matrix - rows are contigs, columns are counts for each
sample:</strong> bams to DGE count matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls</li>
<li><strong>Title for job outputs:</strong> Differential_Counts_edgeR</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Name:</strong> Batch</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing treatment:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Control Name:</strong> Chem</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing control:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Run this model using edgeR:</strong> Run edgeR</li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.  Examine the outputs from the previous step</h4>

<ol>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls</code> file by
clicking on the <strong>eye icon</strong>.
This file is a list of genes sorted by p-value from using EdgeR to
perform differential expression analysis.</li>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR.htm</code>l file. This file has some
output logs and plots from running edgeR. If you are familiar with R,
you can examine the R code used for analysis by scrolling to the bottom
of the file, and clicking <code>Differential_Counts.Rscript</code> to download the
Rscript file. <br />
If you are curious about the statistical methods edgeR uses, you can
read the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">edgeR user's guide at
Bioconductor</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>3.  Extract the significant differentially expressed genes.</h4>

<p>Under Basic Tools, click on <strong>Filter and Sort > Filter</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls</code></li>
<li><strong>With following condition:</strong> c6 &lt;= 0.05</li>
<li><strong>Number of header lines to skip:</strong> 1</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p>This will keep the genes that have an adjusted p-value (column 6 in the table) of less
or equal to 0.05. There should be 47 genes in this file.
Rename this file by clicking on the <strong>pencil icon</strong> of and change the name
from "Filter on data x" to <code>edgeR_Significant_DE_Genes</code></p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 6: Degust</h2>

<p>Degust is an interactive visualiser for analysing RNA-seq data. It runs as a
web service and can be found at <a href="http://degust.erc.monash.edu/">http://degust.erc.monash.edu/</a>.</p>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_degust_1.png" height=400px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"></p>

<h4>1. Load count data into Degust</h4>

<ol>
<li>In Galaxy, download the count data <code>bams to DGE count matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls</code>
generated in Section 4 using the <strong>disk icon</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://degust.erc.monash.edu/">http://degust.erc.monash.edu/</a>
and click on "Upload your counts file".</li>
<li>Click "Choose file" and upload the recently downloaded Galaxy tabular file
containing your RNA-seq counts.</li>
</ol>

<h4>2. Configure your uploaded data</h4>

<ol>
<li>Give your visualisation a name.</li>
<li>For the Info column, select Contig.</li>
<li>Add two conditions: batch and chem. For each condition, select the two
samples which correspond with the condition.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong> and view your data.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_degust_2.png" height=700px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"></p>

<h4>3. Explore your data</h4>

<p>Read through the Degust tour of features. Explore the parallel coordinates plot,
MA plot, MDS plot, heatmap and gene list. Each is fully interactive and
influences other portions on the display depending on what is selected.</p>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_degust_3.png" height=400px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"></p>

<p>On the right side of the page is an options module which can set thresholds to
filter genes using statistical significance or absolute-fold-change.</p>

<p>On the left side is a dropdown box you can specify the method (Voom/Limma or
edgeR) used to perform differential expression analysis on the data. You can
also view the R code by clicking "Show R code" under the options module on
the right.</p>

<h4>4. Explore the demo data</h4>

<p>Degust also provides an example dataset with 4 conditions and more genes. You
can play with the demo dataset by clicking on the "Try the demo" button on the
Degust homepage. The demo dataset includes a column with an EC number for each
gene. This means genes can be displayed on Kegg pathways using the module on
the right.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 7: Gene set enrichment analysis</h2>

<p>The biological question being asked in the original paper is essentially: <br />
<em>"What is the global response of the yeast transcriptome in the shift from
growth at glucose excess conditions (batch) to glucose-limited conditions
(chemostat)?"</em>  </p>

<p>We can address this question by attempting to interpret our differentially
expressed gene list at a higher level, perhaps by examining the categories of
gene and protein networks that change in response to glucose.</p>

<p>For example, we can input our list of differentially expressed genes to a Gene
Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis tool such as GOrilla to find out the GO
enriched terms.</p>

<p>NOTE: Because of time-constraints in this tutorial, the analysis was confined to
a single chromosome (chromosome I) and as a consequence we don’t have
sufficient information to look for groups of differentially expressed genes
(simply because we don’t have enough genes identified from the one chromosome to
look for statistically convincing over-representation of any particular gene
group).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the list of genes <a href="https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/RNASeq_ADVNCD/EdgeR-SignificantlyExpressedGenes-columnOne.tabular">here in a plain-text file</a>
to your local computer by right clicking on the link and selecting Save Link As...</p>

<p>Note that there are ~2500 significantly differentially expressed genes
identified in the full analysis. Also note that the genes are ranked in
order of statistical significance. This is critical for the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the data using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the online
tool GOrilla</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/">cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il</a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Organism:</strong> Saccharomyces cerevisiae</li>
<li><strong>Choose running mode:</strong> Single ranked list of genes</li>
<li>Open the gene list you downloaded in the previous step in a text editor.
Select the full list, then copy and paste the list into the text box.</li>
<li><strong>Choose an Ontology:</strong> Process</li>
<li><strong>Search Enriched GO terms</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Once the analysis has finished running, you will be redirected to a
page depicting the GO enriched biological processes and its significance
(indicated by colour), based on the genes you listed.
<img src="media/rna_advanced_gene_ontology.png" height=300px></p>

<p>Scroll down to view a table of GO terms and their significance scores.
In the last column, you can toggle the <strong>[+] Show genes</strong> to see the
list of associated genes.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with different ontology categories (Function, Component) in GOrilla.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>At this stage you are interpreting the experiment in different ways, potentially
discovering information that will lead you to further lab experiments. This
is driven by your biological knowledge of the problem space. There are an
unlimited number of methods for further interpretation of which GSEA is just one.</p>

<hr />

<h2>[OPTIONAL] Section. Cuffdiff [40 min]</h2>

<p>The aim in this section is to statistically test for differential expression
using Cuffdiff and obtain a list of significant genes.</p>

<h4>1.  Run Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts</h4>

<p>In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Cuffdiff</strong> and set the parameters as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transcripts:</strong> genes.gtf</li>
<li><strong>Condition:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><strong>1: Condition</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> batch</li>
<li><strong>Replicates:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code>
(Multiple datasets can be selected by holding down the shift key or
the ctrl key (Windows) or the command key (OSX).)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2: Condition</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> chem</li>
<li><strong>Replicates:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_cuffdiff.png" height=700px></p>

<p>Note: This step may take a while, depending on how busy the server is.</p>

<h4>2.  Explore the Cuffdiff output files</h4>

<p>There should be 11 output files from Cuffdiff. These files should all begin
with something like "Cuffdiff on data 43, data 38, and others". We will
mostly be interested in the file ending with "gene differential expression
testing" which contains the statistical results from testing the level of
gene expression between the batch condition and chem condition.</p>

<p>Filter based on column 14 ("significant") - a binary assessment of
q_value > 0.05, where q_value is p_value adjusted for multiple testing.
Under Basic Tools, click on <strong>Filter and Sort > Filter</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> "Cuffdiff on data....: gene differential expression testing"</li>
<li><strong>With following condition:</strong> c14=='yes'</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p>This will keep only those entries that Cuffdiff has marked as
significantly differentially expressed. There should be 53 differentially
expressed genes in this list.</p>

<p>We can rename this file by clicking on the <strong>pencil icon</strong> of
the outputted file and change the name from "Filter on data x" to
<code>Cuffdiff_Significant_DE_Genes</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>[OPTIONAL] Section. DESeq2 [30 min]</h2>

<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html">DESeq2</a> is an
R package that uses a negative binomial statistical model to find differentially
expressed genes. It can work without replicates (unlike edgeR) but the author
strongly advises against this for reasons of statistical validity.</p>

<h4>1.  Generate a list of differentially expressed genes using DESeq2</h4>

<p>In the Galaxy tool panel, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Differential_Count</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Select an input matrix - rows are contigs, columns are counts for each
sample:</strong> bams to DGE count <code>matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls</code></li>
<li><strong>Title for job outputs:</strong> Differential_Counts_DESeq2</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Name:</strong> Batch</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing treatment:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Control Name:</strong> Chem</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing control:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Run this model using edgeR:</strong> Do not run edgeR</li>
<li><strong>Run the same model with DESeq2 and compare findings:</strong> Run DESeq2</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.  Examine the outputs the previous step</h4>

<ol>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_DESeq2_topTable_DESeq2.xls</code> file.
This file is a list of genes sorted by p-value from using DESeq2 to
perform differential expression analysis.</li>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_DESeq2.html</code> file. This file has some
output logs and plots from running DESeq2. Take a look at the PCA plot.</li>
</ol>

<p>PCA plots are useful for exploratory data analysis. Samples which are more
similar to each other are expected to cluster together. A count matrix often
has thousands of dimensions (one for each feature) and our PCA plot generated in
the previous step transforms the data so the most variability is represented in principal
components 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2 represented by the x-axis and y-axis respectively).</p>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_deseq2_pca.png" height=400px></p>

<p>Take note of the scales on the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis representing
the first principal component accounts for 96% of the variance and ranges from
approximately -6 to +6, while the y-axis ranges from approximately -1 to +1.</p>

<p>For both conditions, the 3 replicates tend to be closer to each other than they are to replicates from the other condition.</p>

<p>Additionally, within conditions, the lower glucose (chem) condition shows more
variability between replicates than the higher glucose (batch) condition.</p>

<h4>3.  Filter out the significant differentially expressed genes.</h4>

<p>Under Basic Tools, click on <strong>Filter and Sort > Filter</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> <code>Differential_Counts_DESeq2_topTable_DESeq2.xls</code></li>
<li><strong>With following condition:</strong> c7 &lt;= 0.05</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p>This will keep the genes that have an adjusted p-value of less
or equal to 0.05. There should be 53 genes in this file.
Rename this file by clicking on the <strong>pencil icon</strong> of and change the name
from "Filter on data x" to <code>DESeq2_Significant_DE_Genes</code>. You should see
the first few differentially expressed genes are similar to the ones
identified by EdgeR.</p>

<hr />

<h2>[OPTIONAL] Section: How much concordance is there between methods?</h2>

<p>We are interested in how similar the identified genes are between the different
statistial methods used by Cuffdiff, edgeR, and DESeq2. We can generate a
Venn diagram to visualise the amount of overlap.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate a Venn diagram of the output of the 3 differential expression tools. <br />
Note that column index 2 (or c3) contains the gene name in the CuffDiff output.
Similarly column index 0 (or c1) in EdgeR and DESeq2 contain the gene names. <br />
In the Galaxy tool panel, under Statistics and Visualisation, select
<strong>Graph/Display Data > proportional venn</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>
